# velona-thea
A lightweight gallery app that is a frontend for a local image metadatabase <br>
<b> What does that mean? </b> <br>
Data about your images are put into a local SQLite database.. file name, author, tags... which you can search and find images easier. <br> 

Velona Thea does not offer any automatic tagging or such functionality. But you can search using that data if you have it.
